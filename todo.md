# Tasklist

## Responsive Design

This application is currently only designed to be used on a desktop web browser. To make this application more friendly for a variety of platforms, responsive design should be added. This will create a wider audience for people who want to access this application on mobile devices.

## Adjustable Grid Size

The current grid is only useful for very small simulations of the Game of Life. To support a broader array of simulations on this platform, an adjustable grid size option should be added.

## Customized Colors

The current grid is pretty monocolored in a way that doesn't fit the rest of the theme well. The color scheme could use a design upgrade in the color palette, preferably in a way that lets the user customize how it looks.
